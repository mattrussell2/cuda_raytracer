A recursive ray tracer written in C++ and Cuda C

This is a recursive ray tracer written in C++ and Cuda C. 
It was done for a final project in the comp175 graphics course at Tufts. 

The code relies on fltk for a graphical interface, and uses glm for standard matrix/vector operations. 

With gratitude to Remco Chang from Tufts for teaching the graphics course, along with and Roger Alan and Peter Shirley for their great guides on cuda and ray tracing, respectively. 

Also thanks to Rohan Deshpande and Ashley Suh, my project partners!
